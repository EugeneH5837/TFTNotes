theoretically good comps:
kobuko hero aug HOLY 3.89
twin terror lux/amumu 
inkshot comps
kaisa/bruiser
yorick hero aug
duelist
kindred/gnar
blue kayle (dish says feels good on 7 but feels giga shit on 5)
vertical arcanist

comps that should still be good:
aphelios/7fated
kog rr (at least thats what stats say)
yone



3 fated 4 sniper 4 warden

never fast 9 from lose streak, unless its stage 4 losestreak then maybe - dishsoap


highest cap kaisa board for fast 9
kaisa xayah voli ornn udyr lee diana janna azir
really relies on udyr/xayah so this is fast 9
