vertial heavenly without rr if you start with a +1
basically vertical 2 star everything and stack a big carry like kayn?
ok maybe not since dish got +1 heavenly into 2nd aug +1 reaper so

ok apparently 7 heavenly line + melee looks broken according to dishsoap
play around kayn/lee, seems like it needs heavenly + 1



ok i played it with heavenly reroll augment felt pretty good


is 4 trickshot teemo rr BROKEN?
maybe it was only with manazane idk
apparently it is broken, teemo rr that is



capped lilia mythic board is 5 mythic + 4 invoker, can fit exalted on 
some variants

vertical duelist good if +1, unsure how it is without +1


6 warden op asf, lets see if they nerf on live patch, need spat
rumor is DR with warden and porcelain is additive and multi so 6 warden + 4 porc
unit is unkillable




if dryad/warden +1, senaa/gnar rr, gnar seems prio, if you don't hit senna 3,
then can transition to kaisa cause similar items

janna reroll op?



can use bard 2 to fast 9

ORNN S TIER
naut is w/e




fated spat line is usually 7fated with ornn holding spat
otherwise typically 5 fated ofc

standard storyweaver opener 
sivir garen riven teemo(highroll a bit) and sivir/teemo item holders go into
any comp

ap with ashe is syndra/liss

qiyana darius yorick malphite opener
generic ap/melee kinda everything darius can hold for tempo

gnar/senna comp is gnar senna aatrox reksai jax caitlyn

kench/bard reroll, stay at 3 mythic and play 4 bruiser
alt is bard 2 carry to 9 and play 5 mythic or 4 trickshot


final ashe board is 4 warden 3 fated
ashe aphelios syndra illaoi sett amumu naut
can also play cait for ghostly, +1 sniper on syndra for 4 sniper
porcelain spat drop fated for liss + wu/udyr/hwei/azir
fairly reliant on hitting 5 costs cause without them board is a bit shit

capped out lilia board
lila hwei azir annie naut ornn (janna rakan)/(alune sett)

kaisa board if kaisa wasn't shit is 4trickshot 4 warden
kaisa bard teemo xayah jax illaoi sett amumu udyr

7 heavenly + kayn carry you want 2 titans kayn + morg with spat



dont play aphelios without rageblade/shjin (idk which is better but you prob need
at least one of these)



nashors gigabis darius? kurum


ramblinn review:
mythic rr (kog, cho etc) usually not correct, it's playable but said it's better
to have kog just as an item holder and transition into lillia

4 trickshot comp is teemo carry + 4 bruiser + 4 trickshot + storyweaver

scaling janna: GRB + AA + 1
3 story + 2 alt + 2 bruis + 2 drag + 2inv + 2 sage

bard rr: 3 mythic 4 bruiser, gotta hold sivir so you can play story, kayle shred
OR item hold bard tempo to 9

zoe rr 2 variations: not arcanist, it's just 4 bruiser frontline + story + neeko/soraka
for arcanist 2 and altruist 2
4 arcanist + 3 story so instead it's + lux/amumu for warden/arcanist
then you play illaoi so you finish 4 arcan and 2 wardcen still play story


ashe comp still the same just remember you want to angle exalted for 9/10
since it can fit it the easiest

standard lilia comp is 5 mythic 4 invoker
capped lilia is 4 invoker 3 mythic + legendaries so usually tech in udyr + hwei
+ azir. Frontline is naut + udyr + ornn + sett for behe/warden and keep annie

kayn flex = bruiser/whatever you hit frontline, typically kayn + morg + 4 bruiser
cause easier to hit but its whatever you hit just want reaper + 2 ghostly + flex
in exalted

vert heavenly usually need + 1


syndra, only play lean version if + 1 fated othewise standard is duo with ashe:
4 arca + 3 fated + 2 behemoth + ghostly + porcelain + warden

basically if +1 arc -> 6 arc, +1 fated -> 7 fated


tip:
golden remover high skill expression: move tg to tank units, won't reroll
hide support TG


dishsoap says illaoi prob only unit on stage 2 that can farm the dclaw augment
he had a defensive slam + illaoi so he went for it
move item holders easily
EON cheese


high mana champ like 5 costs you usually want shojin, just depends on the interval

9 by 5-1 is fast 9
should have 40-50g to roll ideally

dont play ghostly in gold subscription portal
