Finally hit masters on 7/21

6 zaun zeri - 5th:
- Opened pretty strong with ionia opener + ww + ashe, was kinda stuck between aphel and zeri for ad comp
- Went with zeri because had good mods with virulent and the dmg one that's like ad above 50%
- Zaun crest on 4-2 so went 6 zaun ended up with 6 zaun with sion + sej + liss.
- Prob should have swapped liss with ashe but probably didn't make a diff
- Zeri/gunner design probably aligns with what dishsoap said in that piltover + gunner design is too tied together so if one is shit other is shit.
- Maybe needed to go 4 gunner instead? But didn't hit senna and needed shred
- I think deadeye too good rn so probably should've defaulted into it instead of going for zeri tbh. Got baited by zaun crest.
- Maybe it should've been drop to 4 zaun with the crest and play 4 gunner instead with freljord?
	- So finaly comp would be like:
		- Zeri
		- Jinx
		- Urgot
		- Sion (with spat)
		- Sej
		- Ashe
		- Jayce
		- Senna
- Looking at match history, since sorc is so good rn, dedication is not bad for sorc, is probably okayish on noxus. 
	- Sorc
	- Noxus
	- Challenger
	- invoker?
	- void
