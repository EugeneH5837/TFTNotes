Played like shit today idk lowroll too probably more of user issue though

Random notes from watching Guubums coaching video:
- Evaluating probability when taking stuff like spat on stage 2 carousel, what are chances i probably get boned (Example in video was spat for sorc emblem)
- Sorc comp obv more reliant on spark
- Shiv can be played in invokers because bow and tear are bad components in the comp
	- Makes sense to de-prioritize tear in invokers cause of trait, probably knew this subconsciously but saying it aloud helps remember
	- Also because rod way too valuable in invokers
- Double JG not worth, zzrot is good bow killer as well
