4 freljord + 4 deadeye 5th:
- it's never 4 deadeye unless super stable frontline
- couldnt hit sej 2, open sold jarvan 2 to try and find sej 2 and aphel 2 and also put in sion
- lowrollish game
- is aphel unplayable without guinsoo? kinda feels like it but not sure
- posisbly should've just played akshan shurima variant instead of aphel
	- actually that was prob def the play since i had triforce + ie + runaans
