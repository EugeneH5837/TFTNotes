**MY MIDGAME IS STILL SOOOOOO BAD SOO BAD BAD BAD **

Shouldn't have committed to 7 shurima so early. Needed to have 2* bruiser or jugg and play that with 2* akshan and nasus/renekton. I screwed my mid game tempo sooo badly because of that i'm pretty sure. Ok rolls ok augments? Maybe portable forge as 3rd because thats rng but yeaaaaaaa.

Really need to fix my midgame because i bleed way too hard unless i'm high rolling.
