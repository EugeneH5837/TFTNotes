Watching some robin

akshan broken for sure, ideally db + runaan + 1
frel + deadeye + bruiser + shurima

- Seems like maybe possible to force even with AP opener because since you're rerolling akshan you just jam ap items on liss 3* and ad on akshan
	- ok on second thought this looks like shit
	- ok maybe its not bad but you really have to be bailed out by akshan 3*
	- also robin says hoj not great cause makes you cast before freljord proc 
	- ok so he top 4'd, maybe this line has diff openers and stuff but he also may have gotted bailed out but thats just TFT ig
	- he also had LDP which im pretty sure is still broken

- also just got reminded get two healthy => play taliyah reroll with bunch of 2 costs
	- since you don't have DT, have to do the taliyah roll in combat to get 3* with additional 2*
	- Just remember don't make mistake dishsoap and combine your taliyah on bench by accident and then 3* taliyah no items 
- if you get tricker's can also play taliyah, same shit with re-roll in combat and then bam 3 taliyahs and lots of knockups bingchilling (dishsoap did it)
	- in dishsoap game ended with taliyah 3* taliyah 2*, teemo, sett, nasus, jarvan, ksante, sion
