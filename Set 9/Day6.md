6 noxus seems lowkey good

its just rr kat + darius then go 8 look for sion.
obv better with emblem for a + 1 so you're not playing cass

looking at soju vods against setsuko playing it
stage 4-1 has 4 noxus + ww2 + liss so just best units that he hit.
looking against he also has broken augments (tons of stats + gifts from fallen)
so that prob helped him stabalize before hitting kat + darius

I think don't play 6 noxus unless you have + 1 or sion. cass is kinda shit
