Just remembered possible pivot is if i have 3 combat augments, can play aphelios based on what iniko said a few days ago.

Otherwise akshan rr prob stronger but not sure, regardless i think if contested akshan rr should just go 8 and play aphel 2 maybe (untested could still be shit)

If i hit ravenous hunter, good chance i am contested since a lot of comps use  ww (challenger, noxus, etc.), should just go 8 and play 6 jugg. If i have jugg emblem can put emblem on gwen + play kalista. still play ww carry guinsoo + healing + 1
