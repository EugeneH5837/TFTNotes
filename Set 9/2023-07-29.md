Dishsoap says and i agree, zeri >> aphelios almost always.
Unless you have like triple AD augments then consider

Otherwise prob just play akshan lol

4 gunners only if senna + T HEX + LW or gunner +1 on urgot. Otherwise stick to 2-3

Dishsoap noxus region tech is play challengers cause they use items well and positioning doesnt matter for challengers as much


Watching dishsoap lowroll opener, part of transition was cashing out t-hex then stacking urgot to carry him then swapping to zeri. 

Hoj always on urgot, urgot bis is something like titans/bt/hoj
Zeri you want AD, ideally DB > IE but one atk speed + AD


For Zeri EW good on Sej, DD/Trickers urgot very good

Says only like sorc angle if malz 2 + swain on 2-1
