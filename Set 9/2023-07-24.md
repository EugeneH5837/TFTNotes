If cannot play piltover with gunners from opener, then have GRB with 4 freljord. Greed for it if possible and angling that way.

Basically seems a little similar to release patch where build GRB and flex aphe/azir/zeri.

AP Flex if opener is good i think line is really good and basically just stay stable econ to go 8 and play ahri.
