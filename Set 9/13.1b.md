This patch is worse than the release one.

I think I am over-rolling on 6 and 7 when I shouldn't be.

But also this patch is 7 way contested azir/lux or yas/kaisa.

You don't hit on level 7 rolldown you bot 4. 

Fucking balance thrashing dogshit what the fuck.

It is probably don't play until next patch angle to save mental. Because roll down on 7 meta is so fucking bad I can't.
Will probably evaluate games later but this patch is just so bad. Like I think this is worse than any set 8 or 8.5 patches
in terms of balance even though hero augments are shit.

I hope someone stumbles on this repo because this is so dogshit its crazy.
