went 8-6-8 not playing anymore today shit game

robin says maybe kalista re-roll if you low roll stage 2

I NEED TO STOP ROLLING ON 6 IF I ROLL ON 6 I CANT ROLL ON 7 SO THATS WHY
I WAS GETTING SHIT ON TODAY AND CAUSE MORTDOG POGGERSSERSRSRERSRSEERSR

AP LINES IF NOT HIGH ROLL 8 SORC:
- Velkoz reroll
- 4 strategist 3 shurima 3 demacia

Cannot play darius if no noxus opener (makes sense havent played it before)


Robin testing strat - not re-rolling augments because you cant see same augments later
matters less with tier 1 lets see how he thinks

in sorc demacia comp, it may be play garen instead of sona if no sorc spat for extra frontline.

if primary lux prob dont need sona so go garen, but if velkoz then sona ofc

stable evolution if you don't get void + 1, if you hit void + 1 go for baron.
- just play reksai reroll with 3 void (reksai + kaisa + cho) + bruisers
