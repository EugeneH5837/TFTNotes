Played some AP openers to try out not being contested zeri/aphel after some bad games.

Did pretty well 1st and 3rd but not sure how good it is because i had sorc heart and sorc emblem in both games so went 8 sorc.

Swain 3* seems pretty important to try and hit on roll down when looking for 2* 3 costs.

Provides so much value and is pretty important to keeping your team alive. Will probably try and play more later.
