Day 1 notes

Game 1:
- ornn forge need some kinda tier list but shred not as important this set so cleaver not as great, should've gone DD > cleaver
- shouldn't have gone frej, maybe just sej + bastion insetad for frontline

Game 2:
- idk feels worse made some errors with ionia nad stuff maybe kaisa not that good

Game 3:
- void is 10 way contested every lobby, kaisa also does feel weaker monkahmm


Game 4:
- finally first
- zeri feels pretty good
- end up doing 4 zaun + piltover
- honestly because i got piltover late i think i should've just dropped because t-hex only had 20ish stacks
- also shroud aug is good and guy i beat was dumbass and never moved



DQA advice:
- TF Legend into azir/gunner/deadeye/garen flex
- Rageblade -> winout early -> play whoever you get
- zekes w/e with deadeye/azir but good with other 2

Robin maybe has tech:
lux jarvan teemo sona swain + 2 frontline (taric/sej/sion/2jugs)

Game 5:
- Azir 3 shurima + strategist 4th
- egg cashout was kinda meh i think took too much early dmg

Game 6:
- Zeri gunners + zaun i super lowerrolled and basically clawed my way back from 7-8th so pretty with 4th
- Made correct play to just roll like mad because i was getting railed

Game 7:
- Aphe + Frej
- don't rememberm uch but i think i mainly lost to two strong re-rollers and was kinda weak early.

Game 8:
- Opened guinsoo ionia 1st
- Hit prismatic challenger crown so switched to 6 chall kalista carry
- also decided because region was the one that gives duplicators every stage so ez hit kalista 3* GRB + SHIV + GS
- Also hit gold challenger shield augment.
- Also note is challenger comp we want yas as primary/secondary carry over kaisa it feels like
- Kaisa feels weak af.

Game 9:
- Disneyland kind of game aphel 3* + frej 1st
- Strong mid game taric op af hit aphel 2 ez iirc 
- Had duplicator rolled for aphel 3 win out

Game 10:
- Built diff 3 Gwen + aphel 1st
- Basically played random shit until hit gwen early
- Gwen was also really the only playable unit from that spot since had only AP items early so slammed spark + JG
- Then just 4 costs aphel nasus jarvan sej shen
- Rolled for gwen 3 couldn't hit but ended up being enough cause of bd3 i think 

Game 11:
- Garen rr 5th
- uhhh not sure what went wrong it took forever to get garen 2 so hard to stabalize eventually hit garen 3 but not enough
- never hit kaisa 2 or lux 2 cause stuck rolling on 7.
- Most likely the play was to give up a bit earlier to level to 8 so lux 2* and kaisa 2* maybe thats enough
- Also i think the juggernaut more dmg < 50% hp is kinda shit probably 6 jugg was better since I was offered emblem

Game 12:
- Aphel + 3 frej 1st
- Disneyland game hit aphel early was basically unstoppable ended the game at like 75 hp.
- Highroll kind of game basically winstreak most of stage 2-3 with jhin 2* taric irelia etc


Robin tech:
- low roll opener with tf, open fort into garen rr
