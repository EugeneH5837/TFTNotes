Watching robin stream

Best Ionia lvl 8 board Aphel + Ionia
- Jhin
- Karma
- Aphel
- Irelia
- Sett
- Yas
- Shen
- Taric

Lets you play 2 bastion + 2 targon with aphel + 2 deadeye

I think this is actually better than the kaisa variant.


Did some AP learning:

Sona is pretty good item holder mid game
So following what robin said yesterday you just transition into playing around:
- Lux
- Jarvan
- Shen

lux jarvan teemo sona swain + 2 frontline (taric/sej/sion/2jugs)

Add in ahri at 8. If sorc spat then can play 4 sorc i think with lux + swain + taric + spat


Maybe new meta is run lee sin:
if you hit on a roll, just force trist re roll win game
otherwise choose other one play flex.
