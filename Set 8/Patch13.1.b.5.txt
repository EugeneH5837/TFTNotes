G1:

Mech wukong + hacker lulu: 7th

trolled cause wanted to try out reddit guide. Seems like hacker sucking on PC makes this waay worse than it should be.
Honestly not even sure how i went 7th, i felt decently strong but idr if i just got unlock rolls in playing vs certain people who were kinda high rolling.

G2:

Recon Kaisa 3* + Sett: 5th

Not sure how i got 5th, thought it was top 4 guaranteed.
Maybe cause not ideal items on sett: sunfire, bramble, BT.
Maybe sett just sucks with kaisa or it just is a lot better to play with standard threat frontline than sett.

G3:

Viego oxforce renegade: 2nd

I STILL DON'T GET THIS COMP. I LIKE TOP 2 OR I BOT 2 MAKES NO SENSE.

I think general idea is make very good items on talon to hold + hit viego early ideally with replacement talon for ox + renegade.
This game augs were Jeweled lotus + rich + viego sup. So I think augs really matter a lot. Lotus works well cause then i don't have to go JG then 
I just was strong from early viego hit and greed to go 9.

Like if I have shit augments I will BOT 4 SO PIVOT OUT. Like it really feels like it is unplayable without good augments for it 
like battlemage, camille sup, etc.

G4:

Viego + sett: 2nd

I have no idea what I was doing this game. 2-1 aug was nasus budget thrill and I WINSTREAK LIKE CRAZY STAGE 2-3 WTF?? I just hit lots of pairs 
and the aug just gave so much healing and shit I HAVE NO IDEA. Not sure if just weak af lobby or what but was gonna try and go MF but was like 
3 way contested on MF and some guy high rolled 2 MF 2* so hit viego and just said FUCK IT. I'll take a 3rd cause 2nd guy was 9 laser so BINGCHILLING.

G5:

Vertical anima: 8th

NO MORE VERTICAL ANIMA UNLESS ANIMA CROWN OR EMBLEM EARLY SAY IT AGAIN NO MORE VERTICAL ANIMA UNLESS ANIMA CROWN OR EMBLEM EARLY
NO MORE VERTICAL ANIMA UNLESS ANIMA CROWN OR EMBLEM EARLY NO MORE VERTICAL ANIMA UNLESS ANIMA CROWN OR EMBLEM EARLY.

I also had TERRIBLE UNSLAMMABLE ITEMS EARLY NO MORE ANIMA VERTICAL UNLESS IT IS HAND GIFTED. COULDN'T HIT SHIT ON PAIRS FOR UPGRADING FRONTLINE IT WAS 
AWFUL.

G6:

Recon + SG + Threats: 3rd.

Easily could've top 2'd but was 1 off from kaisa 3* again. So kinda fucked me in the end with high capped boards. Also it maybe may not have been 
LW + HOJ for kaisa. I think because kaisa is better just go double statik instead. Not 100% sure tbh but felt like LW didn't do much for me.
