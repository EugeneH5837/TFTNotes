leblanc ultimate ap carry midgame esp with good admin

If have 2 full items + component on 1* on board and holding pair and found 3rd unit. Can put empty unit
on bench onto board with new item you want. Then combine so that it will pop off component and keep
other two items

corps formation is all tiles AROUND SENNA NOT JUST SAME ROW

ANIMA IS UNCLICKABLE HERO AUG

DO NOT CLICK UNLESS KNIGSLAYER AND KINGSLAYER JUST PLAY RENEGADE.
ANIMA SQUAD SUCKS DO NOT PLAY DO NOT PLAY

it feels like LB > Taliyah tbh this patch idk 
it was def a go admin angle with lb/soraka and just frontline since i had ascension + ap/5s

hold viego items on GP play decent strong stage 2.
Sack stage 3, 4-1 roll for viego 1* and then push 8

Other way is full open into 3-5 for viego, if no hit
then you hit something you can play

also just hold talon for ox force for viego

6 renegade is bait (already knew this)


Items slammable for flex:
hoj, sunfire, gunblade, spark, runaans, tg, titans(?), locket, warmogs, dclaw, redemp, zz rot
