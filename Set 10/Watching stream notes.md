Bebe:

- ascension + guardian good due to inherent stall with guardian

- then just play around ad flex with it, usually like country

- he played superfan opener + headliner kennen + lw slam -> roll for headliner upgrade and took punk panth headliner

- transition into samira reroll with 6 guardian (headliner +1) with country

- ie prio on samira it seems, he rr samira + vex + panth + twitch 3*

- might just be aug diff or something but comp looks weak af, basically playing for top 4

From watching robin/bebe

Basically always hold superfan units if you have the opener since it's basically required to either transition into 5 kda or akali/karthus flex in order to keep 5 kda.
The opener is just too good it seems


Cait lategame just as a reminder is basically just same generic backline as big shot:
- Cait + Ezreal + MF + Lucian
- I think before you get Lucian you don't play mf just play rapidfire?
- I'm still not sure how to play this midgame pre getting lucian for rapidfire + jazz
- I don't think theres a comp rn that you play with cait as primary carry i think?


Robin 4 questions on what to ask yourself on 4-1:
- Sell chosen + roll
- Roll without selling chosen
- Level on 4-2
- Level on 4-

He says a lot of games feels like you have to sell + roll. Also need to scrounge a board with 2-3 cost units



Bruiser naturally lends itself to spellweaver/ap line due to gragas
Ekko superflex most comps
Same with blitz


Dishsoap:
convinced GRB really good on MF


REMEMBER CROWD DIVER ZED IS AN ACTUAL AD OUT, ITS BETTER THAN SITTING ON CAIT AND IF OTHER STUFF (AKA AKALI) IS CONTESTED
JUST NEED DMG + HEALING ON ZED


Robin:
Fast 9

Highroll chosen (Annie, corki, superfan)

Get Econ augment (spoils of war, cluttered/clear mind, patient study, cutting corners, good for something, lucky strike)

Fast 8 on 4-2, sell 1 cost chosen slight roll for 4 cost chosen
Fast 9 on 5-2, sell 4 cost for 5 cost chosen
Roll back down 6-1 for legendary level 9 board 

GGS

DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE OF THE TWO CONDITIONS
YOU WILL GO 8TH YOU ARE NOT SETSUKO
Just play stable 8 roll board or reroll
