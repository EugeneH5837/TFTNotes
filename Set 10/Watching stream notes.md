Bebe:

- ascension + guardian good due to inherent stall with guardian

- then just play around ad flex with it, usually like country

- he played superfan opener + headliner kennen + lw slam -> roll for headliner upgrade and took punk panth headliner

- transition into samira reroll with 6 guardian (headliner +1) with country

- ie prio on samira it seems, he rr samira + vex + panth + twitch 3*

- might just be aug diff or something but comp looks weak af, basically playing for top 4

From watching robin/bebe

Basically always hold superfan units if you have the opener since it's basically required to either transition into 5 kda or akali/karthus flex in order to keep 5 kda.
The opener is just too good it seems


Cait lategame just as a reminder is basically just same generic backline as big shot:
- Cait + Ezreal + MF + Lucian
- I think before you get Lucian you don't play mf just play rapidfire?
- I'm still not sure how to play this midgame pre getting lucian for rapidfire + jazz
- I don't think theres a comp rn that you play with cait as primary carry i think?


Robin 4 questions on what to ask yourself on 4-1:
- Sell chosen + roll
- Roll without selling chosen
- Level on 4-2
- Level on 4-

He says a lot of games feels like you have to sell + roll. Also need to scrounge a board with 2-3 cost units



Bruiser naturally lends itself to spellweaver/ap line due to gragas
Ekko superflex most comps
Same with blitz


Dishsoap:
convinced GRB really good on MF
