Bebe:

- ascension + guardian good due to inherent stall with guardian

- then just play around ad flex with it, usually like country

- he played superfan opener + headliner kennen + lw slam -> roll for headliner upgrade and took punk panth headliner

- transition into samira reroll with 6 guardian (headliner +1) with country

- ie prio on samira it seems, he rr samira + vex + panth + twitch 3*

- might just be aug diff or something but comp looks weak af, basically playing for top 4
