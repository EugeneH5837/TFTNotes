Titans akali sucks
gargantuan resolve also sucks unless edgelord i think anything else is shit

gambler's blade is pretty good, basically takes place of mana-gen item

remember bag size changes

if someone has 3 cost 3* cannot hit (unless duplicator), should probably push level/tempo and roll to pivot based on headliner

if someone has 2 of 4 cost, cannot hit 3*

if someone has 1 of any 5 cost, cannot hit 3*
