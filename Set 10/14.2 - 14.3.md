FRODAN PUNK NOTES:
PUNK SPOT IS 4-5 EARLY JINXES + 1 SLAMMABLE ITEM ON JINX


REROLL



superfan + ap -> karthus/2cost
ad + hs -> hs 
full lose streak + no spot for either -> play exec/exeec

always play for win, natural 5 loss then its ok but dont, if board sucks
don't play weakest board still try to kill stuff
