Robin:

look at units if lots of frontline choose backline chosen vice versa

play chosen stage 2 unless you natural better chosen

3-2: look at board if lots of stuff to hit, sell chosen and roll for better chosen + 
better board

4-1: look at board,  if you need to roll, sell chosen if you can hit a better
one otherwise rolle WITH chosen in.
Try to avoid rolling here if possible, try to level 4-2 8 or 4-5 lvl 8 to get 
access to chosen 4 costs

stage 4-2 go 8 here if enough gold, sell chosen and roll for 4 cost one

4-5 go 8 here roll for 4 cost chosen

5-3/5-5, go 9 roll for 5 cost chosen sona guinsoo

THREAD: General things about set 10 that are important for climbing. 1. Buy headliner units that fill in the holes in your board. Example: It's Usually better to buy a front-line headliner instead of a Cait headliner if you already have Cait pair.

At the same time don't be greedy with which headliner you buy. When rolling down you should be willing to purchase 3-5+ headliners (units, not even considering the trait). Example: It's completely fine to buy headliner Zac when playing Disco.

3. Don't tunnel on getting a specific trait headliner. In general the traits this set are under-tuned at the mid levels of traits (think 5 kda/pentakill/spellweaver). Most of the headliner value is getting the 2star, don't keep your Pentakill Gnar the whole game for 7 penta.
4. Most of the time look to upgrade your headliner after leveling to 6,7,8 and 9. It's extremely efficient to roll with guaranteed headliners every shop. Don't just afk till 8 with a 1 cost headliner.
5. 5. For early game it's often correct to buy either your 1-3 or 1-4 Headliner since it can inform your augment choice. If you buy a 1-4 headliner and don't sell it, look to prelevel on 2-3, since your 2-5 shop will be a headliner shop on lvl 5 odds (higher chances for 2 costs).
6. 6. This might be a personal preference thing but this set I'm going to be very adverse to taking something that will hard-commit me to a line. Bag size changes makes playing contested brutal so I will be avoiding trait augments unless I know 100% i'll be uncontested.
