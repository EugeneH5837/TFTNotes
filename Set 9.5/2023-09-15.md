B patch today, just random notes from watching stuff

hard nerfed stuff: nilah, bilge, qiyana rr

azir should still be viable with slight nerf

i think with nilah nerfs and no xayah buffs, vanq is even worse unless you have triple combat and even then idk
probably ONLY play if you have ionia emblem

4 gunner + 4 zaun
+1 is aatrox
another +1 prob heimer or w/e

slayer is like
4 slayer morde + fiora duo carry
morde
fiora
kayle
reksai
quinn

2 open slots can go bruiser + challenger maybe? so like sej + kaisa/ww
or if we're playing challenger can play ww + jugg like nasus
maybe its always sej at 8 so you can play ashe for frel

seems kinda shit tbh idk prob no play

6 slayer
morde + azir duo carry
tank items on nasus
- morde
- kayle
- quinn
- qiyana
- reksai
- aatrox
- jarvan
- nasus

alternative morde comp is 2 slayer:
- quinn/morde + juggs
- 4 bruiser 4 slayer?


4 jugg 3 bilgewater 2 strat nilah-azir duo carry 

nasus + darius + naut + 1 jugg
azir + nilah + mf
+ 1 should probably be a random 5 cost

4 jugg morde + azir duo carry from ramblinn:
- morde + azir
- jarvan + naut + nasus + aatrox (sett/ww before)
- swain + jarvan for strat

wokege comp i see on ramblinn is 4 gunner jayce/taric rr bastion frontline:
- 2 gunner + 4 bastion + 2 targon
- rr 3* jayce/taric
- Ad items on jayce like DB/RFC + 1 like hurricane
- taric wants evenshroud + 2 tank items

nilah def looks still playable

vanquisher comp seems not great unless you have a +1 either ionia or vanq, otherwise too many dead units

maybe play urf?
