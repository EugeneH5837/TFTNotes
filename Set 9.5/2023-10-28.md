Just saving old notes

9.5 is a terrible set.
**Terrible.**
Quit the set stuck d3-d2.

## Old stuff from idk when

kaisa BIS morello

no items matter but BT + 1 for fiora
entire comp is hit on 4-1




triple titan's illaoi tech?

nashors TF reroll good

BB + JG + Nashors/Deathcap/GS/GB



dishsoap stream watch:
jg not good on azir, put on silco

kurum stream:
azir is more of an augment/zhonyas/tempo check
probably should avoid defaulting unless i am on good tempo from early

on 7 its always just 4 strat standard comp, if i hit aatrox early just drop naafiri
can play naafiri on 8 prob but should use that slot for something better

if game shoves azir items on you and you have cassio 2, just play
probably better to just hard force xayah rn


socks morde tech
prio nashors > rfc
you need 3 stacks of noxus

I wanna highlight one of my findings when digging through stats: 
Ashe 2 is much better than Nilah 1. Only swap to Nilah when 2-starred or if we have Nilah items that don't work on Ashe (BT, EoN).
