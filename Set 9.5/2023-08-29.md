First day PBE

Very dizzy new items have to re-learn

One good comp i've seen that you kinda need decent amount of items for is fiora morde duo

Comp:
- Morde
- Fiora
- Jarvan
- Swain
- Azir
- Samira
- MF

Gives you very good frontline 4 costs. Fiora seems a bit nutty cause ability makes her invulnerable and melts tanks. Seems like comp maybe fiora primary then just jam AP/bruiser/tank items on morde.

Gives you 4 strategist + 3 noxus + 2 challenger + 2 slayer + 3 demacia. So actually not that many items needed since you get radiant demacia on fiora.
