Patch 13.18b

This patch still sucks ass, basically only one comp to default for 4 costs and its challenger. Otherwise need too many conditions or just play reroll whenever you have an angle.

Following is just various notes from a few days of watching/playing stuff

ORNN -> lean companys that want lots of items can abuse manazane zhonyas
Ex: Azir Silco/sorcs
Master Yi -> lean challengers/sorcs
battle ready/gotta go fast really good for these two comps
pumping up gunners
robotic arm -> jinx rr

be more open to RR when possible
CHO RR
SAMIRA RR
GRAVES RR

IF NOT
FLEX CHALLENGERS/SORCS/AZIR SILCO DEPENDING ON LEGENDS

the boss
ravenous hunter



only way to really play slayer is demacia opener -> morde carry

AD items -> Vanq/Gunner/Challenger fiora items
AP -> Sorc/Cho/azir

nasus items more important for azir is what dishsoap says


ramblinn good challenger opener is cassio + renek for item holding kaisa + fiora items


dishsoap stream notes
sorc is tempo comp, should generally only play if you have the units early


**don't default into 4 costs besides challenger**

zhonyas -> azir playable
silco needs setup
sorc without +1 is not great


open with something like noxus/void/ionia/chall

can play vanq/ionia if i have opener and + 1

play reroll whenever opener gives it

rogue opener -> play rogue
good ixtal are ice/wood/stone

robotic arm -> jinx rr
