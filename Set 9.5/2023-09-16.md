played like shit yesterday general thoughts before spamming games:

3 way ap flex;
silco sorc
challenger kaisa
azir

ad opener -> gunner
if too contested or hand-gifted, play vanq for top 4 if above tempo


other comps:
5 demacia 2 slayer morde + fiora duo

rogue opener -> 4 rogue qiyana/ekko rr


noxus opener:
morde carry prio RFC


high tempo and lots of money:
jugg/azir

azir variants from ramblinn:
- 4 jugg azir + silco duo
	- pretty expensive so like mentioned above need to be winstreaking ideally
	- jarvan + swain for strat
- 4 jugg azir nilah duo
	- add in nilah + mf for bilge + strat
	- this may suck like shit now cause of nerfs but idk
	- avgs 4.12 with both 2 star sooo probably expensive like other one
- 4 jugg azir + morde duo
	- prio rfc morde
	- 4 jugg + swain + jarvan
	- not sure what to play if no aatrox, probably just sett and fuck slayer until then?
- 6 shurima azir + morde duo
	- ONLY PLAY WITH SHURIMA + 1
	- probably play reksai before getting aatrox for slayer + bruiser
	- otherwise has to be sett/naut/jarvan
- 4 jugg azir + xayah
	- xayah sucks this is a desperation play most likely if i have AD items and cant play morde
	- 4 jugg nasus/darius/sett/naut
	- shen + xayah for 3 ionia (feels req for xayah) and darius gives vanq
	- + jarvan for strat
	- this shit looks expensive af
- azir + fiora duo
	- 4 shurima + 3 demacia
	- jarvan + fiora + sona for demacia
	- azir + naafiri + nasus + taliyah for 4 shurima
	- aatrox, probably play naut/sett before, but aatrox is BIG for 2 darkin
